# GA-Perturbation
Some time ago I discussed with my friend jokingly about GA might be good to make minimum perturbation for machine learning models. This might be true, might be false. Working on it might trigger some PTSD we have from what's supposed to be a philosophical AI mod. Unironically, I'm now curious whether this might work or not.
